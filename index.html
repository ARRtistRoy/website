                <div class="col-md-8">
                    <p>
                        As you know by the title of this site, my name is Roy E. Reynolds. I am an artist, web designer,
                         and all around creater of things. My small art business is Arrtist Creations, which you can find
                         here <a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/aRRtistRoyCreations" target="_blank"> Etsy Page </a>.
                         So, I really love creating. I've understood how to code, mainly in Java, html and css, for several
                         years now. Just recently, however, I've moved into web design and web app creation. In my new journey
                         I've been learning many more languages. So far I've introduced myself to Ruby, Ruby on Rails, PHP, and SQL.
                         I also plan to learn many more languages. Lets just say I really enjoy coding.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                         I'm also, an artist, which I have found comes in very handy when creating websites for myself.
                         Most of the art used on my websites was created by me. I'm very knowledgable in digital painting, and photo manipulation.
                         It was also where I first learned wire framing (just in a very different sense).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                         When it comes to experience I do have quite a bit of educational experience in coding, web design, and art, but
                         I admit that I'm new to the game. Most of the real world work exprience that I have is in critical thinking and problem solving.
                         For one, I'm a US Army veteran. In the military I was a ground surveillance systems operator. In short I used radars and rf based
                         ground sensors to monitor movements in a given area. I also had a hand in prototype testing, which I cannot give many details in.
                         In short I have a bit of understanding in prototyping and testing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                         In summary, I have a strong determination to continue to learn and grow, a great sense of attention to detail,
                         critical thinking, and problem solving experience. Most importantly, when I don't know something,
                         I really know how to Google. I also know how to repel out of a helecopter. If these are things that you are looking for in an employee,
                         then I'm your guy. <a href="#contact">Contact me</a>.

                <p>
                    Delivering food, with Bite Squad, is more than just taking food to customers. This job intails a fair amount of
                    critical thinking, problem solving, and land navigation skill. This is also a job that requires
                    a lot of employee integrity, since it involves a minimal amount of direct supervision. The job is
                    controlled mainly by a phone application, so some troubleshooting is often involved.

                <p>
                    I know this does not quite count as a job but in order to get the best out of my education I gave my full time and
                    attention to my studies. This was made possible by support from Veterans Affairs and my wife. <br>
                    I obtained training in: Project management, UX design and development, Java, Html, Adobe Dreamweaver,
                    Human Resources, Team management, Cyber Security, Public Speaking, and Most of the Microsoft Office Suite products (listed below). <br>
                    While this is a 5+ year gap in my employement, I still gained a large amount of training, experience, and skills. All worth mentioning.
